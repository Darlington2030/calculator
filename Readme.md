# Calculator

A web-based calculator that enables users to perform basic mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage calculations. The calculator supports parentheses and includes an interactive, styled interface.

## Project Description

This calculator project demonstrates fundamental HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, creating an intuitive interface for users to conduct basic mathematical operations directly in the browser. The main goals of this project include:
- Building a responsive user interface with a visually appealing layout.
- Implementing JavaScript logic to support a variety of mathematical operations.
- Allowing users to clear, backspace, and calculate equations interactively.
  
### Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the calculator layout.
- **CSS**: Styles the calculator and ensures a user-friendly interface with responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the calculator's functionality and mathematical operations.

### Challenges and Future Enhancements
Some challenges included managing parentheses input dynamically and formatting large numbers with commas. Future improvements may involve adding more advanced operations (like trigonometric functions) and enhancing the UI/UX with additional themes.

## Installation

To install and run the calculator locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   
   git clone https://github.com/Darlington2030/calculator.git
   
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   
   cd calculator
   
3. **Open the HTML file**:
   Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to start using the calculator locally.

## Usage

### How to Use the Calculator

1. Enter numbers and mathematical operators using the calculator's interactive keys.
2. Click **AC** to clear the current input, **Backspace** to delete the last character, and **=** to evaluate the expression.
3. The calculator supports **basic operations** such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and percentages (%).
4. Use the **( )** key to add parentheses for complex expressions.
   
### Example
To compute `(7 + 3) * 5`, simply press:
1. `(`, `7`, `+`, `3`, `)`, `*`, `5`, and `=`

The calculator will display the result in the output field.
